                <p>Learning with curiosity, creativity, and movement. We believe
                    that the arts can be leveraged to increase interest and engagement
                    with STEM topics and create more inclusive classrooms. 
                    Our curriculum is a unique blend of STEM and the arts. Each
                    activity is designed to explore STEM topics through creativity 
                    and movement.
